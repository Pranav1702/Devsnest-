  <h5>Subject: <u>Devsnest 30 Days program for student Welfare</u></h5>
  <p>Dear Mr. Manoj Goel,</p>
  <blockquote>
      <p>This letter is to inform you about the devsnest's 30 day training program.
    This program helps the students to learn in a responsive environment where they can 
    grow individualy as well as a group. The program includes some of the best handpicked
    questions that have been asked in <u>Amazon interviews,Flipkart interviews and other companies</u> as well. The program
    focuses on a strong DSA foundation and also provides a development environment for the students to make
   mistakes and learn together. Please schedule a meeting so that we can take the talk further.</p>
   <p>Hoping for your Positive Response</p>
  </blockquote>
